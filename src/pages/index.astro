    a: "It's our commitment to you. If your real estate agent finds any issue with our clean related to our checklist, we will return to rectify it free of charge within 72 hours. We work with you to ensure your bond is returned." 
  },
  { 
    q: "Is the price on my quote final?", 
    a: "Yes, the price is fixed for the details you provide. The only time a price may change is if the property's condition is significantly different from described (e.g., more rooms, extreme soiling). We will ALWAYS discuss and confirm any changes with you before starting extra work." 
  },
  {
    q: "Do you service areas outside of Ipswich?",
    a: "Absolutely. While we are based in the Ipswich region, we proudly service many surrounding areas, including Springfield Lakes, Brisbane's western suburbs, and more. Check our service area list or contact us to confirm your location."
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in a standard bond clean?",
    a: "A standard bond clean is a comprehensive, top-to-bottom clean of the entire property, following a detailed checklist approved by real estate agencies. This includes everything from ovens and light fittings to skirting boards and windows. We also offer carpet cleaning and pest control as separate services."
